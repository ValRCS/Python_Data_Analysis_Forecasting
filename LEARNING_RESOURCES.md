## Additional courses - mostly slower paced than current one

* https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python - FREE and  good fundamentals
* https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python -  by IBM Ph.D - free and short / basics
* https://www.udemy.com/course/learning-python-for-data-analysis-and-visualization/ - quite extensive but paid (Udemy has constant 10-15 Euro sales).
